## Project requirements

## Business rules
- The idea of Campus eats to deliver food to those who order it from within the campus premises and also to ensure that outsiders don't come into the campus for delivering food. So, either students, faculty or any person related to the university can take up the role of a driver. The driver has to register their driver license details and vehicle registration details into the system. Upon receiving an order, the driver has to go the restaurant to collect the order and drop it off at the location of its delivery. The user/customer would be able to rate the driver (driver rating) and the restaurant from which the food was ordered (restaurant rating).
